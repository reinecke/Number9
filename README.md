# Number 9
A set of python utilities for Grim Fandango game file conversion

----
## What is this?
As a hobby project I've been writing some file format converters for [Grim Fandango](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango) game files.

----
## How do I use it?
More documentation is forthcoming. For now I just wanted to dump my old stuff in github, I'll try to add more info soon!
